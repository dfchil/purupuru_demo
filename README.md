## This is: 
Demonstration of some unexpected behaviour with KOS and purupuru packs (only tested with original SEGA packs).

## Problem that needs fixing
Sometimes when sending purupuru commands, it results in the controller being unreadable/unavailable for the following 4 frames.

## How does this work
All the interesting stuff is in the [./code/game/core.c](code/game/core.c) file

This demo tries to show this by registering which controllers are present at program start and sending a puru-puru command to available packs every 31th frame. 
All controllers are scanned for availability every frame, and if a controller that was registered at program start becomes unavailable, the port number and frame number is printet to stdout. 

In my experience the error isn't always triggered, but when it is, the unavailability of the controller lasts for 4 frames.
